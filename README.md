## Design Patterns

This project implements several design patterns to ensure code maintainability, scalability, and efficiency, such as:

1. **Singleton:** Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
2. **Builder:** Allows for the construction of complex objects step by step.
3. **Bridge:** Separates an objectâ€™s abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.
